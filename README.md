# Cryptography Project

This project is a Python-based implementation of classical cryptographic algorithms, designed to provide a hands-on understanding of encryption and decryption techniques.

## Features

- **Multiple Cryptographic Algorithms**: Implements classical ciphers including Vigenere, Caesar, and Transposition ciphers.  
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Provides functionality to both encrypt and decrypt messages efficiently.  
- **Case Handling**: Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters in input text.  
- **Non-Alphabetic Character Management**: Safely ignores characters that are not part of the alphabet.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Offers a straightforward command-line interface for ease of use.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ranjith9743/cryptography-project.git
